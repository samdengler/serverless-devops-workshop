# Getting a jump-start for your project

In the following modules, you will learn how to create with a few clicks a complete serverless "hello world" web application project that comes with source code management, a build pipeline, and JIRA integration if you want to.

Furthermore, you will see how you can test your API and your serverless functions locally and we will show you how you can easily add your own application logic.

We will use a cloud-based IDE in your browser to work on your project.
